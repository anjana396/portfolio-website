            <h2>Northeastern University</h2>
            I am currently a junior at Northeastern University, pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Finance, with an expected graduation in 2026. 
            My academic journey has been shaped by a desire to merge these two disciplines and explore how they intersect in industries driven by innovation 
            and data. I intend to leverage my understanding of both fields to help develop products and services that incorporate cutting-edge technology with 
            financial strategies, benefiting businesses and consumers alike. My interest in these fields was first sparked in high school, where I was part of an 
            advanced curriculum that focused on both Computer Science and Economics. During this time, I also completed an internship at an electronics retailer, 
            which allowed me to further explore my interest in technology and its real-world applications. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a technical 
            degree that balances both finance and technology.As I progress through my studies, I have continued to build on my technical foundation with real-world experiences. I recently completed a summer internship 
            at an IT solution provider, where I expanded my skill set by working with various software tools. Currently, I am honing my technical expertise by 
            developing proficiency in Java, Python, React, etc. while simultaneously enhancing my analysis skills with tools such as Power BI.
