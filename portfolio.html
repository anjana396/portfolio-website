                The Portfolio Optimization project I developed focuses on applying financial analytics to achieve optimal asset allocation within a diversified portfolio. 
                The primary objective of the project was to minimize risk while maximizing returns, in line with the principles of modern portfolio theory, based on one of 
                the concepts I learned from one of my finance classes. Using historical financial data, I created an algorithm that helps determine the best allocation of 
                assets based on expected returns and associated risk levels. This approach ensures that portfolios can achieve a balance between risk and reward, allowing for 
                informed investment decisions.
                For this project, I used Python and the Pandas library to handle the necessary data analysis. By implementing optimization algorithms, I was able to explore different 
                portfolio configurations and evaluate their performance based on metrics such as expected return and volatility. This process involved calculating risk-adjusted returns 
                and assessing how various combinations of assets perform under different market conditions. Although the project did not involve training machine learning models or using 
                large datasets, it provided a clear demonstration of how computational methods can be applied to real-world financial scenarios. The project was a valuable exercise in 
                understanding how portfolio theory can be implemented practically and is available on GitHub for further exploration and refinement.
